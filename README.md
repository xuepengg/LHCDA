# Label-aware Hierarchical Contrastive Domain Adaptation for Cross-network Node Classification(LHCDA)

This repository contains the author's implementation in PyTorch for the paper "Label-aware Hierarchical Contrastive Domain Adaptation for Cross-network Node Classification"

# Environment Requirement

• python == 3.6.13

• torch==1.10.1

• numpy==1.19.3

# Datasets

input/ contains the 3 datasets used in our paper, i.e., acmv9, dblpv7 and citationv1.

# Code

"model.py" is the LHCDA model.
"train.py" is an example case of the LHCDA model for Cross-network node classification on one dataset.
